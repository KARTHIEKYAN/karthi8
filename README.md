# Vision Stick

A Blind Stick for visually challenged people... :)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a building Blind Stick.

A Smart Blind Stick could revolutionize mobility assistance for visually impaired individuals by integrating advanced technology. Here are some features and concepts for such a device


Obstacle Detection: Utilize ultrasonic sensors or cameras to detect obstacles in the user's path. The stick could then provide haptic feedback, such as vibrations, to alert the user of obstacles.

### Technical Requirements

Power supply
Ultrasonic sensor
Water sensor
buzzer
software = Arduino IDE
language = embedded C.
